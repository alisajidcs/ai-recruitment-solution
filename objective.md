## Project Background

A next-generation AI recruitment solution designed to streamline and modernize talent acquisition by integrating seamlessly with existing HR systems. It ingests job requisitions and candidate profiles via secure APIs, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse structured data such as skills, experience, qualifications, and location preferences. A powerful semantic matching engine scores candidates based on contextual relevance, dynamically adjusting weightage for factors like job seniority, domain expertise, nationality, and language proficiency. A central dashboard displays open roles, candidate summaries, data sync status, and model health, with export options available in CSV/Excel. This system aims to reduce time-to-hire, improve candidate quality, and empower recruitment teams through intelligent automation.

**Objective:**

To develop a lightweight prototype that reflects the key capabilities of a recruitment intelligence system. The prototype should demonstrate data ingestion, candidate-job matching views, and intelligent UI componentsâ€”all integrated through APIs.
